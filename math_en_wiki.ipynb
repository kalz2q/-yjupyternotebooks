        "Adding\n",
        "Adding is a way to put two numbers together. You use the \" + \" sign for the adding operation. If you have 5 apples and a friend has 6 apples, you and your friend have 11 apples. This is 5 + 6 = 11 using the signs of Mathematics, and is read \"five plus six equals eleven\".\n",

If you have 5 apples and give 3 to a friend, you then have 2 apples left. This is 5 – 3 = 2 using the signs of Mathematics, and is read \"five minus three equals two\".\n",

If you have 4 apple trees and every tree has 25 apples, you have 100 apples. This is 4 × 25 = 100 or 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100 in the signs of Mathematics. The first way is shorter and easier to use.\n",

        "Dividing\n",
        "Dividing is a way of subtracting a number many times. It is the opposite of multiplying. You use the \" ÷ \" or \" / \" sign for the dividing operation. If 3 friends take an equal part of a bag of 12 apples, every friend gets 4 apples. Or, you may take away (subtract) 3 apples from the bag of 12 apples, exactly 4 times until the bag is empty. This is 12 ÷ 3 = 4 or 12 – 3 – 3 – 3 – 3 = 0 in the signs of Mathematics.\n",
